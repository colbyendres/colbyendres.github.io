        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I'm a former student of Texas A&M University, holding degrees in applied mathematics and computer science.
          My talents lie in the intersection of these two fields- namely applying mathematical reasoning and software
          engineering to solve challenging real-world problems. From machine learning to high performance computing to
          web development, I've had the opportunity to apply my skills across a wide breadth of fields.
          This space is a curated snapshot of my projects, academic milestones, and ongoing curiosities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Below are various updates about a variety of different things. For a more detailed exposition on what I've been up to,

            I finished graduate school, earning a Master's in Computer Science from Texas A&M University. 
            My summative project was called AggieAssign, which you can learn more about <a class="text-emerald-400" href="musings/aggieassign.html"> here </a> and <a class="text-emerald-400" href="pdfs/AggieAssign_Report.pdf"> here</a>.
            I'll be moving to Austin and am excited to begin my professional career full time!

            As a member of the Texas A&M Competitive Disc Golf Team, I competed in the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/90154" class="text-emerald-400"> MidSouth Collegiate Open </a> in Jonesboro, AR. 
            This event featured 158 competitors from over 30 different universities and was one of the largest events of the collegiate season.
            Congrats to the Texas A&M A Team for taking down the event!

            I completed my degree, obtaining a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics with Honors from Texas A&M University. I intend to continue my education by pursuing a master's degree in computer science.
            The program begins next January, and if all goes well, should be completed in the summer of 2025.

            I accepted an Research Engineer internship at <a class="text-emerald-400" href="https://www.tactcomplabs.com"> Tactical Computing Labs</a>!
            I'll be working on math kernel libraries (e.g. BLAS, FFTW, and the like) designed for RISC-V architectures. I'm excited to use my mathematical
            education for real-world applications.
